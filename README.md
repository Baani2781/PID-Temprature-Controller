# PID-Temprature-Controller
PID-based temperature control of a thermal system using MATLAB and Arduino
This project implements a PID-based temperature control system on real hardware.

## Overview
A thermal system was modeled using system identification and first-principles physics.
PID parameters were tuned in MATLAB and implemented on Arduino for real-time control.

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Arduino
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- PTC Heater
- MOSFET

## Key Learnings
- Difference between simulated and real-world system behavior
- Practical challenges in PID tuning
- Translating control theory into hardware implementation
